# Petchain_analytics
This repository would be dedicated to processing, analyzing, and potentially visualizing the vast amount of health data generated and stored on Starknet by your petchain_contracts. 
Its primary goal would be to derive insights and provide value to pet owners, veterinarians, and potentially even researchers.
